        "\n",
        "This worksheet guides you through practical exercises in test specification and verification. You'll practice the core skills from Modules 1-3: writing specifications, designing test strategies, and working with AI to verify code quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
        "- Write clear specifications using assertions\n",
        "- Apply systematic frameworks for test design (Given/When/Then, Equivalence Partitioning)\n",
        "- Make strategic decisions about test adequacy and risk\n",
        "- Evaluate AI-generated code and tests for simplicity and correctness\n",
        "- Practice the Specify → Generate → Verify → Refine cycle\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Role:**\n",
        "You are the **strategic architect**. AI is your implementation assistant. You decide:\n",
        "- What needs testing (and what doesn't)\n",
        "- How comprehensive tests should be\n",
        "- Whether code is simple enough\n",
        "- When to ask AI for improvements\n",
        "\n",
        "**AI-First Approach:**\n",
        "We focus on \"specify and verify\" rather than manual coding. You'll learn to clearly communicate requirements to AI, then critically evaluate results."
